==============================================

-------------- CLASS Board_matrix ------------

"""
    We will use 'myBoard' for instances of Board_matrix() in the examples
"""

-   Board_matrix(size)
    /* Crates object Board_matrix */
    size --> Tuple of (i,j) coordinates

-   print_board()
    /* Prints the board */

-   rotate_board(direction)
    /* Rotates the matrix in an especified direction */
    direction --> Takes two values: [ myBoard.CLOK|myBoard.ANTICLOCK ]

-   transpose_matrix()
    /* Transposes the matrix */

-   grow_board(size, diagonal=0)
    /* Adds rows and columns from the start of the main diagonal [0] or from the end of the main diagonal [1] */
    size --> (rows, cols) How many rows/cols to add


-------------- CLASS Point ----------------

"""
    We will use 'myPoint' for instances of Point() in the examples
"""

-   Point(parent)
    /* Crates the object Point and asigns to a parent matrix */
    parent --> Object Board_matrix that the point is in

-   setPoint(i, j, value)
    /* Sets the point in a position and asigns it a value */
    i --> Row from 0
    j --> Column from 0
    value --> Value of the point

-   getPoint()
    /* Returns a tuple of de 'i' and 'j' coordinate */

-   remove_point()
    /* Removes the point from the board and */ 

-   move(dir)
    /* Move the point from its position the 'n' steps on dir tuple */
    dir --> (i,j) Tuple with steps on each axis

-   moveTo(dir)
    /* Move to an specific coord in board */
    dir --> (i,j) Tuple with coordinates on each axis

-   __eq__
    /* The comparation '=' with other point check if both have the same 'i' and 'j' coordinates and not necesarily the same value */


---------------- CLASS Body ----------------

"""
    This class allows operations with a group of points, the points can be created and setted with a body method to set all the ponts 
    at the same time, or the points could be allready created and setted on the board but want to group them
"""

-   __init__(parent, points)
    /* Create the group object */
    parent --> myBoard object
    points --> List of the points to group

-   setPoints(coords)
    /* Set the position of the points of the body and its value */
    coords --> List of lists with the 'i' and 'j' of each point and its value ((0,0,1), (1,0,1), (0,1,1))

-   move(dir)
    /* Move all the points at the same time 'n' steps */
    dir --> List of steps on each axis

-   moveTo(dir)
    /* Move all the points to an specific point using the first pased point as reference */
    dir --> Position to move fist point
